__🌱 Plant Performance Dashboard (Power BI)__

__📌 Project Overview__

The Plant Performance Dashboard is an interactive Power BI analytics solution built using the Plant_DTS dataset.    
This dashboard focuses on manufacturing plant performance, downtime tracking, and production efficiency.  
It helps plant managers and business stakeholders monitor operations, identify bottlenecks, and improve productivity using data-driven insights.  

__🎯 Business Problem__

Manufacturing plants often struggle to answer questions like:
  
Why is production efficiency dropping?  
Which machines cause the most downtime?  
Which plant performs best?  
How much production is lost due to downtime?  

Raw Excel data makes these insights difficult to extract quickly.  
This dashboard transforms raw operational data into actionable insights.  

__📂 Dataset Used__

File: Plant_DTS.xls  
The dataset contains operational plant data including:  
Plant / Location information  
Production metrics  
Machine performance  
Downtime tracking  
Time-based operational records   
This dataset represents a manufacturing performance tracking system.  

__🛠️ Tools & Technologies__  

Power BI Desktop  
Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)    
Data Modeling & Relationships   
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
Excel Data Source  
  
__🔄 Data Preparation Steps__

Before building the dashboard, the dataset was transformed using Power Query:  
Cleaned inconsistent values  
Removed null / duplicate records  
Converted data types (date, numeric, categorical)  
Created relationships between tables  
Created calculated columns & measures using DAX  

____📊 Dashboard Features____  

1️⃣ Executive KPI Summary
  
High-level metrics to evaluate plant performance:  
Total Production  
Total Downtime  
Efficiency %  
Performance Trends  
Key Operational KPIs  
This section gives management a quick health check of plant operations.  

2️⃣ Production Analysis

Visuals include:  
Production trends over time   
Production comparison across plants  
Output contribution by category  

📌 Helps answer:  
  
Which plant produces the most?  
Is production increasing or decreasing?  

3️⃣ Downtime Analysis (Key Insight Area)  

This is the core focus of the dashboard.  
Visualizations show:  
Total downtime by plant  
Downtime by machine / category  
Downtime trend over time  
Major causes of downtime  

📌 Helps identify:

Machines causing frequent stoppages  
Areas where production is being lost  
Opportunities for preventive maintenance   
 
4️⃣ Plant Comparison  

Compare performance across multiple plants:  
Efficiency comparison  
Production vs downtime  
Best vs worst performing plants  

📌 Helps management allocate resources effectively.

5️⃣ Time Intelligence Analysis   

Time-based slicers allow analysis by:  
Year  
Month  
Date  

📌 Enables:    

Seasonal trend detection   
Performance tracking after improvements  
Period-over-period comparison  

🎛️ Interactive Filters  

The dashboard includes slicers for  
Plant  
Time period
Machine / Category  
Operational metrics  

Users can dynamically explore the data without technical knowledge.
